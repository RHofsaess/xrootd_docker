### Ubuntu 22.04 docker setup for XCache
Setup with development container for xrootd to test changes for the proxy.
It is a minimal setup with logging to file, but without a redirector, no monitoring.
NOTE: the images from `ubuntu_testing` must be build and available for using this stack!

The full stack runs:
  - the server, serving the files in ./store [using the minimal-server image]
  - the proxy, configured with the configs given in ./configs [using the compile image]
  - the client, using the XrdClProxyPlugin

**NOTE: The X509 proxies need to be renewed, if you want to use external data sources with auth!**


----- general -----
1) setup folders:
  `$ mkdir cache`
  `$ mdkir store`
  `$ mdkir certs`
  `$ mdkir build`
  optionally:
  `$ mkdir logs`
2) copy X509 proxy, if necessary:
  `$ cp <proxy> ./certs>`
  and adapt `docker-compose.yml`

----- remarks -----
The setup currently uses the prebuild images from `ubuntu_testing` for the server and the client.

For a new run, evtl clean the build dir before restarting.

----- docker compose -----
setup:
  `$ docker compose up -d`


----- setup servers/ run testing -----
The provided setup automatically starts a server, compiles and runs the proxy, and start a client
that pulls data from the server over the proxy.

1) server:
  - started automatically with docker compose
  - on startup, the ./scripts/server.sh script runs
  - logging to /logs/server.log
  **NOTE: The export directory (/store) can be owned by root**

2) proxy:
  - started automatically with docker compose
  - there are two ways to run this container:
    1) selecting ./scripts/build_and_run.sh as an entrypoint in the docer-compose-yml builds xrootd 
       from ../xrootd into ./build which is mounted as a bind mount
    2) selecting ./scripts/proxy_compiled.sh starts the proxy without building
  - logging to /logs/proxy.log
  **NOTE: The /cache directory must be owned by xrootd for writing!**

3) client:
  - Auto mode: ./scripts/client.sh as entrypoint performs a data transfer automatically on startup
  - Manual mode: connect as a client and use XRootD
    `$ docker exec -it client-minimal-1 bash`
    **NOTE: For versions < 5.6 and > 5.3.1, it is necessary to use "XRD_CPUSEPGWRTRD=0" to avoid a bug in xrootd!**
    e.g.: `$ XRD_CPUSEPGWRTRD=0 xrdcp -d 2 -f root://10.5.0.6:1094//root://10.5.0.5:1094//storage/<file> .`
  - logging to /logs/client.log


----- plain docker [outdated] -----
building image:
  `$ docker build --rm -t ubuntu_compiled .`

run (no compose):
  `$ docker run -it -v /home/rhofsaess/working_dir/computing/xrootd_docker/xrootd:/xrootd -v ./configs:/xrdconfigs -v ./build:/build -v /cvmfs/grid.cern.ch/etc/grid-security/certificates:/etc/grid-security/certificates ubuntu_compile`
  Eventually, more folders need to be mounted (certs etc)

building xrootd:
  run `scripts/build_xrd.sh`

  `$ cd /build`
  run cmake:
  `$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=. ../xrootd

  # support VOMS: -DENABLE_VOMS=True
  # support HTTP TPC: -DENABLE_VOMS=True -DBUILD_MACAROONS=1
  # support XrdClHTTP: -DXRDCLHTTP_SUBMODULE=1
  # support Erasure Coding: -DENABLE_XRDEC=True
  # support ASAN (CentOS 8 only): -DENABLE_ASAN=True

  run make:
  `$ make -j 8`
  add user xrootd:
  `$ echo "xrootd:x:9997:9997::/home/xrootd:/bin/bash" >> /etc/passwd`

  To run the server:
  `runuser -u xrootd -- /build/src/xrootd -c /xrdconfigs/CONFIG`
